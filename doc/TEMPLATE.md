# [Feature Title]

## Instructions

**IMMUTABLE. This section MUST be preserved verbatim in every design
document, every version. Do NOT edit, summarize, reword, or omit.**

Living document. Born at conception, lives with the project. Early versions
will be wrong. That is expected. The document converges on truth over time.

### Sections

- **Rationale** — the problem, stakeholders, forces. No solutions.
- **FR-NNN** — what the system must do. Amend in place, mark `(revised)`.
- **TBD-NNN** — open questions = preserved decision space. May linger.
- **DEC-NNN** — decisions made. TBD-N becomes DEC-N (same number).
- **ACT-NNN** — implementation tasks. Move to Done when finished.
- **Done** — one-liner per completed ACT.
- **Scratch** — raw dump. User or agent, anytime. Process periodically:
  promote to FR/TBD/ACT or discard.

### Process

The user starts with prose, ramblings, half-formed ideas. That is the input.
The agent's job is to extract structure from this — FRs, TBDs, DECs — by
**interviewing the user. One question at a time.** Do not batch questions.
Do not assume answers. The interview continues throughout the life of the
document, not just at creation.

### Rules

1. **NEVER renumber.** Numbers are identifiers, not order. Renumbering
   breaks every cross-reference. Do not do it.
2. **BEFORE EVERY DEC: scan the entire TBD list.** Does this decision
   narrow or foreclose ANY open TBD? If yes, you MUST state it in the DEC.
   This is not optional. This is the most important rule in this document.
   Unknown unknowns exist — this will not catch everything. Do it anyway.
3. **When an FR changes: scan ALL downstream DECs, TBDs, ACTs for impact.**
   Do NOT proceed until impacts are assessed and flagged.
4. No 1:1 mapping between sections. Cross-reference freely.
5. **TBDs linger** until they block the critical path. Do NOT resolve
   TBDs early to tidy the document.
6. History is in git. Do NOT version items inside the document.
7. **Build for now.** Not for hypothetical futures. Requirements WILL
   change.
